# Podcast-Recommendation-Engine
The goal of this project was to create a recommendation engine for episodes of the "Jocko Podcast" based on the transcripts of the episode, in hopes to find episodes that have similar content to one another. To do this I used NLP techniques such as TFIDF,  Latent Dirichlet Allocation, andCosine Similarity.
